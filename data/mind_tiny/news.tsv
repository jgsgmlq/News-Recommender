"This is an opportunity to pay homage to my father, a great man, a great friend, a great inspiration," said Spicer, ""I'd like to dedicate this dance to my dad and all the fathers out there suffering from cancer but still being the best dad that they can." The theme of the show was Disney Night and Spicer danced as the character Woody from Toy Story 4. His quickstep was his most well received dance and he earned his first 7 score from the judges. After his performance, Spicer became emotional because Disney Night reminded him of one of his last memories with his father.

Read on to learn about 15 abandoned places you can explore only through photographs unless, that is, you're willing to risk a trespassing charge (something we strongly discourage).

The hair spray, makeup and catchy pop tunes touched up with distortion were made for MTV. Though there really wasn't much substance to the music, the scene was popular to the mainstream nonetheless. So we've decided to rank our 20 hair metal bands of all time. But before we go on, bands like Def Leppard, Kiss, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Extreme and Tesla are not on this list. While, yes, some of these groups made massively successful pop-tinged metal albums during the '80s, they were either already successfully established hard-rock acts before this time and went for some easy money or were unjustly lumped into the genre thanks to MTV.

N31527	video	popculture	'Voice' fans love heartthrob who looks like 'combination of Tom Cruise and Christian Bale'	The Battles began on The Voice Monday, with a new set of mentors (Usher, Darius Rucker, Normani, and wil.i.am) and a new rule allowing coaches to save one contestant each from elimination. But before all that, there were a few more Blind Auditions, including one form Season 17's new heartthrob, Matthew McQueen. He may not be related to Steve McQueen, but he had undeniable star power -- with a pretty face and a pretty voice to match plus just the right about of darkness and edge. "He kind of looks like a combination of Tom Cruise and Christian Bale. You're like a very handsome movie villain," John Legend told Matthew. "Like a vampire. You could be in a vampire movie," said Kelly Clarkson, who seemed a little flustered as she called the 21-year-old indie-pop crooner "so cool and sexy -- I mean, not in a weird way!" Blake Shelton compared Matthew's modern-sounding vocals to that of another heartthrob, Shawn Mendes. So I guess music really was in Matthew's, um, blood. [insert/quote some tweets] Matthew's cover artist-of-the-moment's Lewis Capaldi's weeper "Someone You Loved" was haunting, and not just because he looked like Lestat while singing it. I was impressed by his sense of dynamics, the way he started soft and subtle and built the song to its anguished crescendo, instead of starting at full volume. It was a sophisticated and nuanced performance. "You got better and better and you kept it classy, you kept it tasteful. When you get into that rasp -- like, whew," Kelly marveled. It seemed like Kelly might be on her way to a third victory by getting Matthew on her team, but unfortunately for her, Blake also turned around. He made a very good case, noting that three of his past six winners were not country singers, stating, "It doesn't matter what lane your coach is in. It's what lane your coach can put you in." Combine that with the fact that Grandma McQueen had dreamed that Blake would turn for Matthew, and it was a done deal. Now Blake might win again with another non-country artist. "With his range and his pocket -- this guy is a threat to this entire competition," Blake proclaimed.	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAINtDs.html	[{"Label": "Christian Bale", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q45772", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [75], "SurfaceForms": ["Christian Bale"]}, {"Label": "Tom Cruise", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q37079", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [60], "SurfaceForms": ["Tom Cruise"]}]	[{"Label": "Blake Shelton", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q94831", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [825, 1623, 1907, 1965, 2104], "SurfaceForms": ["Blake Shelton", "Blake", "Blake", "Blake", "Blake"]}, {"Label": "Kelly Clarkson", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q483507", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [681, 1488, 1519], "SurfaceForms": ["Kelly Clarkson", "Kelly", "Kelly"]}, {"Label": "Christian Bale", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q45772", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [539], "SurfaceForms": ["Christian Bale"]}, {"Label": "Lewis Capaldi", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q42315001", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [1045], "SurfaceForms": ["Lewis Capaldi"]}, {"Label": "Tom Cruise", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q37079", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [524], "SurfaceForms": ["Tom Cruise"]}, {"Label": "Darius Rucker", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q445405", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [73], "SurfaceForms": ["Darius Rucker"]}, {"Label": "Normani", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q28148022", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [88], "SurfaceForms": ["Normani"]}, {"Label": "Steve McQueen", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q159347", "Confidence": 0.943, "OccurrenceOffsets": [338], "SurfaceForms": ["Steve McQueen"]}, {"Label": "Usher (musician)", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q165911", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [66], "SurfaceForms": ["Usher"]}, {"Label": "Shawn Mendes", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q17198340", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [912], "SurfaceForms": ["Shawn Mendes"]}, {"Label": "John Legend", "Type": "P", "WikidataId": "Q44857", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [599], "SurfaceForms": ["John Legend"]}, {"Label": "Someone You Loved", "Type": "N", "WikidataId": "Q60768202", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [1069], "SurfaceForms": ["Someone You Loved"]}, {"Label": "Blind audition", "Type": "C", "WikidataId": "Q4926628", "Confidence": 1.0, "OccurrenceOffsets": [232], "SurfaceForms": ["Blind Auditions"]}, {"Label": "Lestat de Lioncourt", "Type": "R", "WikidataId": "Q2295321", "Confidence": 0.909, "OccurrenceOffsets": [1138], "SurfaceForms": ["Lestat"]}]
